Residing on Server Side, there's always a need to be one step ahead to provide APIs for client side teams to consume. To enable seamless development and parallel processing. Here comes a thin wrapper to generate mock GraphQL API responses via OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo in Ruby apps.

When Real APIs are ready, tweak the configuration. Its minimal :heart:

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This gem requires Ruby 2.6+
Also it requires [graphql]('https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby') to override its ability to generate responses
